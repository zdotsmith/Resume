        <h4>Research Overview</h4>
        <p>For my final year dissertation, I investigated the forces exerted by woody debris collisions on bridge piers during flooding events. This research aimed to improve our understanding of bridge durability and enhance the accuracy of failure predictions in flood-prone areas. The project's importance lies in its potential to inform bridge design and maintenance strategies, ultimately contributing to more resilient infrastructure.</p>
        
        <h4>Methodology</h4>
        <p>I began by conducting a thorough literature review, gathering information from various sources on woody debris behaviour, bridge engineering, and fluid dynamics. This provided a solid theoretical foundation for the experimental phase. Using SolidWorks, I designed a scaled bridge pier model which I then 3D printed for use in flume experiments. This approach allowed me to conduct controlled experiments under various flow conditions, debris masses, and collision angles.</p>
        
        <h4>Data Collection & Analysis</h4>
        <p>To collect data, I used a load cell to measure impact and drag forces under different flow rates. I then applied statistical and dimensional analysis methods, including Froude and Reynolds numbers, to ensure accuracy and extrapolate results to real-world scenarios. For data analysis and visualisation, I utilised MATLAB and Python, demonstrating my proficiency with industry-standard software tools.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Findings</h4>
        <p>My research findings revealed both linear and quadratic trends in the forces experienced by bridge piers during debris collisions. Notably, I identified a linear relationship between flow velocity and peak forces, while observing quadratic trends between flow velocity and drag force. Interestingly, the observed peak forces were lower than initially predicted, suggesting potential limitations in assumptions and highlighting areas for further research.</p>
        
        <h4>Skills Demonstrated</h4>
        <p>This dissertation project allowed me to demonstrate my research capabilities, analytical thinking, technical expertise, and ability to effectively communicate complex engineering concepts. It also highlighted my problem-solving skills and attention to detail throughout the experimental process. It also demonstrated my ability to design and execute experiments, analyse data, and draw meaningful conclusions from complex datasets. The insights gained from this study contribute to the broader field of bridge safety and infrastructure resilience, with potential applications in improving bridge design and maintenance strategies in flood-prone areas.</p>
